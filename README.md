# Hi, I’m Mastermind


Seven years ago, I was building and deploying web apps—hands-on with everything from HTML and CSS to modern JavaScript stacks. After stepping away, I’ve spent the last year shifting gears and going deep into cybersecurity.
Now, I’m putting in the hours to master blue team skills: SOC operations, Linux, Python, Bash, and real-world security labs. I thrive on breaking down problems, building solutions, and learning through direct action—not just theory.
I’m currently stacking up industry certs (eJPT, Google Cybersecurity, and more), documenting everything I learn, and making the transition from developer to defender. My goal: join a security team where I can apply my builder’s mindset to defending systems and responding to real threats.

📍 Porto | Open to SOC analyst, blue team, or junior security roles.
